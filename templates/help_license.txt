usage: license [src] [file]

	Appends a copyright or license message to the top of each class within
	a source directory. Also generates a global 'LICENSE.txt' file in the
	working directory.
	
	If no src directory and text file paths are specified, this command
	will run against the 'src' and 'license' resource types within the
	project's .mlib settings file (see 'mlib help config' for more details).
		
	The license text file can include some basic tokens that will be generated
	at run time. For example: '::year::' will be replaced with the current year
	
Optional parameters:

  [src]   : Relative or absolute path to a src directory. If not set will use defaults
            specified within the project's .mlib settings.

  [file]   : Relative or absolute path to a text file. If not set will use defaults
            specified within the project's .mlib settings.


  -no-source-license    : disables source files (.hx) license text being updated
