usage: hxml [file] [-target type] [... options]

	A utility for preprocessing a hxml file prior to compilation.
	
	Unless a specific target type is set, actions will run against
	all compilation targets in the file (as separated via '--next' flags);
	
Required Parameters:

  [file]            : Relative or absolute path to a hxml file


Processing Options:

  -resource [path] : Recursively add all files within the specified directory
                     as -resource statements in the hxml. Supports relative and
                     absolute path to a directory of haxe resources. 

                     Each resource uses the file name as the identifier.
                     E.g. 'path/example.txt' will map to 
                          '-resource path/example.txt@example'

Other options

    -target [type] : Limit the processing to one or more target types
                     through a comma delimited string

                     e.g. '-target neko' or '-target swf,wf9'
