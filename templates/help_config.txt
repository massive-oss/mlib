usage: config

	Configures the working directory for working with mlib.
	This command creates a stub '.mlib' settings file and 'haxelib.xml'
    in the current directory.

Optional flags:

   -override <value>   : Override existing files (allowed values are 'all',
                         'settings' and 'haxelib'. Defaults to 'all' if set

Settings File
    
    The settings file allows the user to specify which resources should
    be included in the haxelib package (and where they should be located
    within it).

	A settings file has the following xml format:

	<mlib bin="path/to/bin">
		<resources>
			<resource type="src" path="haxe/src" />
			<resource type="src" path="neko/src" />
			<resource type="src" path="tool/src" dest=""/>
			<resource type="run" path="mlib.n" />
			<resource type="license" path="resource/license.mtt" />
			<resource path="file.txt" dest="dir/foo.bar" />
		</resources>	
	</mlib>
	
	See https://github.com/massiveinteractive/MassiveLib for more details
	
	Note: If the last character in a path is a slash "/" then mlib will use
	each child directory of the path instead.
