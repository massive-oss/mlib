Error: allClasses has been removed

    This command was intended as a catch all to ensure all classes within
    a lib were compilable prior to release.

    The same result can be achieved using munit and mcover.
        
        munit test -coverage

    To only test a specific package or src update munit config in the project

        coveragePackages=foo.bar
